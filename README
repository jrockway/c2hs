               C->Haskell - Haskell Interface Generator              -*-text-*-
               ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

C->Haskell is a interfacing tool that eases Haskell access to C libraries.
The tool gets information about the C data type definitions and function
signatures by analysing the C header files of the library.  It uses this
information to compute the missing details in the template of a Haskell
module---called the binding file---that implements a Haskell binding to the C
library.  Hooks embedded in the binding file signal where, which, and how C
objects are accessed from Haskell.  The Haskell code in the binding file
determines Haskell types signatures and marshaling details.  Further
information is at

  http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~chak/haskell/c2hs/

      inteface produced with C->Haskell (ie, closed proprietary licenses are
      possible, too).  In other words, I do not care what you use C->Haskell
      for or to whom you are giving C->Haskell or any interfaces generated with
      C->Haskell, only if you modify or improve C->Haskell itself, you have to
      contribute your changes back to the community.  Nevertheless, I will of
      course be particularly delighted if you choose to make your work freely
      available.
