--- DESCRIPTION ---------------------------------------------------------------
--
--  This module provide some information about the specific implementation of
--  C that we are dealing with.
--
--- DOCU ----------------------------------------------------------------------
--
--  language: Haskell 98
--
--  Bit fields
--  ~~~~~~~~~~
--  Bit fields in C can be signed and unsigned.  According to K&R A8.3, they
--  can only be formed from `int', `signed int', and `unsigned int', where for
--  `int' it is implementation dependent whether the field is signed or
--  unsigned.  Moreover, the following parameters are implementation
--  dependent:
--
--  * the direction of packing bits into storage units,
--  * the size of storage units, and
--  * whether when a field that doesn't fit a partially filled storage unit
--    is split across units or the partially filled unit is padded.
--
--  Generally, unnamed fields (those without an identifier) with a width of 0
--  are guaranteed to forces the above padding.  Note that in `CPrimType' we
--  only represent 0 width fields *if* they imply padding.  In other words,
--  whenever they are unnamed, they are represented by a `CPrimType', and if
--  they are named, they are represented by a `CPrimType' only if that
--  targeted C compiler chooses to let them introduce padding.  If a field
--  does not have any effect, it is dropped during the conversion of a C type
--  into a `CPrimType'-based representation.
--
--  In the code, we assume that the alignment of a bitfield (as determined by
--  `bitfieldAlignment') is independent of the size of the bitfield.
